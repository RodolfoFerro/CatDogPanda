# (🐱|🐶|🐼) Real-time classifier

## Setup

To use this RT-classifier you must have installed [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/). I highly suggest you to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).

The requirements to run this repo are:
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [Keras](https://keras.io/)

I've also created a `environment.yml` file with a basic stack of packages. This can be easily installed wich Anaconda by running:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml python=3.6
```


## Usage

To simply run the script you just need to:
```bash
python rtclassifier.py
```
